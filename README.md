# DPT-classifier
The DPT classifier is a supervised machine learning model trained on scRNA-seq data to accurately classify CD4⁺, CD8⁺, and rare DPT cells. Using a random forest algorithm with optimized parameters, the model achieved 99% accuracy, enabling robust identification of T cell subsets at single-cell resolution.
